# Set a powerful default for ALL text files.
# This tells Git: "For any file that you think is a text file, I want you to
# ensure it has LF line endings when it's committed to the repository."
# This is a stronger rule than just 'text=auto'.
* text=auto eol=lf

#
# Define the EXCEPTIONS to the rule below.
#

# These Windows-specific script files MUST have CRLF endings.
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.bat text eol=crlf

#
# These files are binary and should never be touched.

*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ttf binary
*.otf binary
